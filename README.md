# Jon-Chretien_project

"Imitation is the highest form of flattery."
 
# important

Practice your HTML and CSS skills by rebuilding the website jonchretien.com.

Your aim is to:

� Recreate the site as closely as possible to the original

� Use your own HTML

� Use your own CSS

 # Layout of the site

The website must include the following sections (in this order):

� Intro

� Selected works

� Photography

� Work experience

� Currently listening

� Footer

 # Instructions

Open up your text editor and start creating the layout needed for the website. If you encounter an element or section that you battle to build, go ahead and inspect the code used to build the original. Use this as a reference and try not to copy and paste the original websites code.
